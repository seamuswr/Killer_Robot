ME 405 Term Project - The Glue Boys -
Autonomous Nerf Launcher with Target Lock On

This final project for our Cal Poly Mechatronics class combined a cooperatively multitasking software base with 
a robust mechanical system. The robot was tasked with autonomosly dueling another team. A few special rules include 
the target freezing after 5 seconds, 3 points for first team to hit, 1 point for the second team to hit, and -1 points
for a miss. With some refinement the device is best suited for keeping younger siblings out of certain areas. 

The hardware for this project consisted of a strongarm nerf launcher attained from class, two brushed dc motors and 
corresponding encoders, an Mlx90640 thermal camera, and an Nucleo-64 board with a motor driver and Shoe of Brian.
All components were attached to a plywood base. Th
